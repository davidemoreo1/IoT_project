We create a device to hel coffee farmer all around the word to prevent coffee disease. 
Scientists studied that the coffee rust grow up in certain weather condition, in certain range of temperature, humidity, altitude and soil moistur.

Our device collect all of this information and send the data on the cloud throught SigFox and show them on a DashBoard.

In this repository is possible to find the arduino code, the hardware documentation and the dashboard documentation.

The components of the group are:

-Edilene (France)-> Project Manager

-Jerry   (Taiwan)-> software
-Davide  (Italy) -> website
